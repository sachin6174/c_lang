// File I/O In C: C Tutorial In Hindi #62
// With this tutorial, we will be moving towards files in C. Files are an essential part of any program as we can take input from and print output in files. We can also save a lot of program space by accessing the file's data only when needed, making the program more efficient and faster.

// Our next 2 to 3 tutorials are based on files too. So in this one, we will learn about the basics of files and why we need them.

// Purpose of files in C:
// Files are used to store content hence reducing the program's size.
// We can read or access data from files.
// The data in files remain stored even after the program's execution is terminated.
// Files are stored in non-volatile memory. To understand what a non-volatile memory is, we have to see the difference between volatile and non-volatile memory.

// VOLATILE MEMORY

// NON- VOLATILE MEMORY

// The data can only remain in it while the computer’s power is on.

// The data will also be present in it while the computer’s power is off.

// Can only hold information when having a constant power supply

// Can also hold information, in case of inconstant power supply

// Will hold data for a short period.

// Will hold data for a long term.

// RAM is an example

// Hard Disk is an example.

// So due to the above differences, we can conclude the reasons we need files.

// Types of Files:
// There are two types of files:

// Binary Files
// Text Files
// Binary Files:
// Binary files stores data in 01 i.e., binary format.
// They are not directly readable.
// An application or software is required to read binary files.
// An example is a .doc file.
// Text Files:
// They store data in simple text format.
// They are directly readable.
// No software is required to access them.
// An example is a .txt file.
// Operations on files:
// By using C language, we can perform four different tasks related to files. We will see them theoretically in this tutorial, and in the next one's, we will see their practical implementation.

// Creating a File:
// We can create a file using C language, in any directory, without even leaving our compiler. We can select the name or type we want our file to have, along with its location.

// Opening a File:
// We can open an existing file and create a new file and open it using our program. We can perform different operations on a file after it has been opened.

// Closing a File:
// When we are done with the file, meaning that we have performed whatever we want to perform on our file, we can close the file using the close function.

// Read/Write to a file:
// After opening a file, we can access its contents and read, write, or update them.

// Conclusion:
// We can perform many operations using files, as we can read, write, or append them. We can also open, close, or create a file. Using files in our programs can make them much more efficient and save a lot of memory space. We can also store our data for an extended period.
