	// Place your snippets for c here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Print to console": {
		"prefix": "main2",
		"body": [
			"# include <stdio.h>",
			"int main()",
			"{",
			"$2",
			"return 0;",
			"}",
